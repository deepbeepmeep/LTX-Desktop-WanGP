# Full-resident on Darwin means the *full* bf16 transformer (no fp8 path on MPS,
# unlike CUDA) sitting in unified memory alongside the Gemma text encoder, VAE,
# upsampler, activations, and the OS/Electron/app itself. A live test at ram_gb=19
# (48 GB machine, other apps open) picked this tier before this floor existed and
# stalled — torch/driver allocation climbed past torch.mps.recommended_max_memory()
# and the process sat there paging instead of progressing or erroring (no crash, no
# OOM, just stuck) — so the failure mode this floor guards against doesn't announce
# itself; there's no clean OOM to notice in testing by accident.
#
# 85 is arithmetic from real checkpoint bytes (model_download_specs.py), not a
# hardware measurement, converted to GiB since get_available_ram_gb() divides by
# 1024**3:
#   - transformer (ltx-2.3-22b-distilled-1.1.safetensors): 46_149_345_334 B = 42.98 GiB
#   - Gemma text encoder (gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized, bf16): 25_000_000_000 B = 23.28 GiB
#   - VAE + active latent workspace: ~7.3 GiB estimate (unverified) for a 5s/1080p
#     clip (this app's max local resolution/duration); decode is tiled
#     (default_tiling_config() in ltx_pipeline_common.py), so this term likely
#     doesn't scale up much with resolution the way a naive pixel-count estimate
#     would suggest, but that's not confirmed either
#   -> subtotal 73.5 GiB, +~15% margin for MPS allocator fragmentation/driver
#      overhead against the silent-stall failure mode above -> 85
#
# Still UNVERIFIED on real hardware. Do not lower further without confirming on a
# machine that actually has this much RAM free.

    - "unsupported": local generation is not viable; caller must route to the API.
    - "streaming_models_loading": enough memory to run, but model weights must be
      streamed from pinned host RAM (15-30 GB range on CUDA).
    - "full_models_loading": enough memory to hold the whole model resident, so
      streaming is skipped to avoid unnecessary host-RAM pressure.

    On CUDA (Windows/Linux) the memory figure is discrete (total) VRAM, and
    "full_models_loading" (>=31 GB) holds the fp8-halved (~23 GB) transformer
    resident. Pass ``fp8_capable=False`` (ROCm today — see
    ``runtime_config.accelerator.accelerator_backend``) to stay on the streaming
    path regardless of VRAM: without fp8 the full ~42-46 GB bf16 transformer
    would try to stay resident at that floor and OOM. On Apple Silicon (Darwin)
    there is no discrete VRAM — the GPU shares system RAM — so ``ram_gb`` is the
    *available* (free) RAM, not total: total RAM overstates real headroom once
    the OS/Electron/app are already running. Gated on MPS being available
    (i.e. Apple Silicon, not an Intel Mac, which has no MPS backend and stays
    unsupported). ``fp8_capable`` is ignored on Darwin (no fp8 path on MPS).

    Darwin's "full_models_loading" (>=``DARWIN_FULL_RESIDENT_FLOOR_GB``) is NOT the
    same regime as CUDA's: MPS has no fp8 path, so it holds the *full* ~46 GB bf16
    transformer resident — roughly 2x CUDA's resident footprint at its own
    full-loading floor. Below that, Darwin streams (mmap via OffloadMode.DISK, not
    CUDA's pinned-host-RAM-then-copy OffloadMode.CPU — see
    ``services.ltx_pipeline_common.offload_mode_for_prefetch_count``). Streaming was
    the only Darwin path validated end-to-end (M4 Pro, 48 GB); the full-resident
    tier above is unverified on real hardware, see ``DARWIN_FULL_RESIDENT_FLOOR_GB``.
